# n³
`n³` (pronounced `/ˈen ˈkjuːb/`) is a collection of little scripts to bootstrap
new **Node.js** projects and make my (and hopefully others 🙂) life easier with
automating certain repetitive tasks.

#### What does n³ stand for?
Initially I named the project `n`, but I quickly realised there is already a
[Node.js version manager with that name][1]. Although the next item in the
series would be `n2`, I liked the sound of `n³` more and decided to just go with
this solution.
